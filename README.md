# Customer-Conversion-Analysis
One of the ways in which companies measure the success of their marketing efforts is the percentage of people who progress from 
visiting their web site to accepting their offers for products and services. We refer to this percentage as the "conversion rate".  

One day, at a marketing team meeting, someone says: "Our conversion rate is down". Here we investigate whether this claim is true. 
We take a look at the conversion data and try to understand what is happening to the conversion rate and determine if the conversion 
rate is down and, if so, why it is down.
